## API

Go setup:
https://golang.org/doc/install

You may need to:

* Update PATH (Go gets saved to /usr/local/go). In Linux, add this to .bashrc: `export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH`
* Add GOPATH. This is the reference to your workspace - the place where your Go files will be. Something like `export GOPATH=/home/sass/school/andmebaasid/api`
